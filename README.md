# Byteball-Discord-bot
The project is still in progress and will not work, I recommand that users should wait for this one to be completed before making a fork or downloading it.

I am planning to make a discord bot so byteball can broadly get accessed by more and more users even if they are not using byteball wallet. The bot i am creating is a unique project that may encourage users to not download official wallet but the bot will help byteball to make an approach to more users. The bot will do basic byteball functions as well as some unique approach will be added by the time.

Features:
The bot can be able to collect Unit Id Info
Gives you info about how many bytes you have.
You can make polls with a secure id
You can vote on polls with the id
Transfer funds to others and with Conversion features. E.g.:- If you want to send 10 USD worth of byteball or 0.001 BTC worth of Bytes or with any Coin Gecko registered currency, Which means more than 2200 Options.
Get Assets info.
Custom name attestation.
and try to implement more features by the time.
Note:- You, However need some bytes in account with this bot to access it's some features and that's why a wallet is required on any platform to transfer some bytes over this platform.

Security:-
You can have option to store if but by default, Bot won't store your wif.
